                <h2>Bridging Finance, Machine Learning, and Frontend: My Journey Across Three Domains</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the past few years, I’ve been fortunate to explore and grow in areas that seem different on the surface but are deeply interconnected: finance and consulting, machine learning and deep learning, and frontend development. While many professionals focus on just one of these domains, I’ve found immense value—and excitement—in working across all three.

                <h2>How Finance and Consulting Became My Core Passion</h2>
                <p>My journey into finance and consulting began out of pure curiosity during my summer holidays. I immersed myself in modules, real-world case studies, and classic finance texts. What started as a summer learning project soon turned into a strong personal interest.

                What excites me most about this field is the blend of strategic thinking, analytical depth, and real-world business impact. Whether it's breaking down company financials or solving business problems through consulting frameworks, I enjoy the process of making data-driven decisions that can influence how businesses operate and grow.

                <h2>Machine Learning: A Perfect Blend of Logic and Creativity</h2>
                <p>
                    My second passion is machine learning, which I’ve studied extensively using tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and a wide range of Python libraries. I’ve applied ML to real-world datasets, building regression models, classifiers, and recommendation systems that provide tangible insights.

                     What makes machine learning so fascinating to me is its ability to find patterns in data and its potential to automate decision-making at scale. As I delve deeper into deep learning, I'm exploring how neural networks and computer vision models (like CNNs) can be used for complex tasks such as rock classification or predictive modeling

                <h2>Frontend Development: Bringing Ideas to Life Visually</h2>
                <p>
                    Frontend development came to me out of necessity—building interfaces for my projects. But as I worked more with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I began to enjoy the creative control it offered. Being able to turn an idea into a responsive, intuitive web interface is incredibly satisfying.
                    Working on full-stack or ML-integrated web projects gave me a broader understanding of user experience and how design and function can go hand in hand. It’s helped me present data models not just through code, but through interactive and visually meaningful dashboards or websites.

                <p>
                  I don't just write about finance, machine learning, or frontend—I build things too. From predictive models and consulting dashboards to full-stack web apps, my GitHub is where all the real experiments live (yes, even the ones that broke spectacularly before they worked).<br>

                  You’ll find a mix of passion projects, learning experiments, and code that reflects the journey I’m on.
